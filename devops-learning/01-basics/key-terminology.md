# Essential DevOps Terms

Below is an up-to-date list of key DevOps terms, each with a clear and simple definition to help you build a strong foundation:

| **Term**                   | **Simple Definition**                                                                                           |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DevOps**                 | A practice combining development and operations teams to deliver software quickly and reliably.                  |
| **Agile**                  | An approach focusing on iterative development, frequent delivery, and collaboration.                            |
| **Continuous Integration (CI)** | The process of merging all developers’ code to a shared repository frequently, with automated tests.          |
| **Continuous Delivery (CD)**    | Automatically preparing and deploying tested code changes to production quickly and safely.                   |
| **Pipeline**               | A set of automated steps that code goes through to move from development to deployment.                         |
| **Version Control (Git)**  | A tool tracking all code changes and enabling teams to collaborate and revert changes if needed.                 |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | Managing servers and cloud resources with code/scripts, not manual steps (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).       |
| **Automation**             | Using tools/scripts to repeat tasks automatically instead of by hand.                                            |
| **Container**              | A lightweight, portable package that bundles software and everything it needs to run (Docker).                   |
| **Orchestration**          | Coordinating and managing multiple containers or services (e.g., Kubernetes).                                    |
| **Artifact**               | A file or package generated after building code, ready for deployment or testing.                                |
| **Monitoring**             | Watching applications and infrastructure for issues or performance problems.                                     |
| **Alerting**               | Notifying teams automatically when monitoring finds something wrong.                                             |
| **Microservices**          | Building apps as a collection of small, independent services that can be developed and deployed separately.      |
| **Blue/Green Deployment**  | A release method where two environments are used to switch traffic with zero downtime.                           |
| **Canary Release**         | Releasing new software updates to a small group first, then rolling out to everyone if stable.                   |
| **Rollback**               | Reverting a software update to a previous version if issues occur.                                               |
| **Configuration Management** | Using software to standardize and automate system settings and deployments (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef).     |
| **Immutable Infrastructure** | Servers or systems that are never changed after creation—replaced with new ones when updates are needed.      |
| **Secrets Management**     | Safeguarding passwords, keys, and sensitive data (e.g., with Vault).                                             |
| **Load Balancer**          | Directs incoming traffic evenly across servers to keep apps running smoothly.                                    |
| **Provisioning**           | Setting up new servers, networks, or cloud resources, usually with automation.                                   |
| **Cluster**                | A group of servers that work together for high availability and load balancing.                                  |
| **Artifact Repository**    | A storage solution for build outputs and dependencies (e.g., JFrog Artifactory, Nexus).                         |
| **CI/CD Runner/Agent**     | A machine or service that executes jobs in CI/CD pipelines, like running tests or deployments.                   |
| **Container Registry**     | A service for storing and managing container images (e.g., Docker Hub).                                          |
| **Environment**            | A specific setup where apps run—development, testing, staging, or production.                                    |
| **Deployment**             | The act of making software or updates available to users or production systems.                                  |
| **Scaling**                | Adjusting computing resources up or down to handle traffic or workload changes.                                  |
| **Runbook**                | A guide listing the steps to troubleshoot or perform operations tasks.                                           |
| **Observability**          | The ability to understand what’s happening inside a system by examining its outputs—metrics, logs, and traces.   |
