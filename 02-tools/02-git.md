# How Git Is Used in DevOps (with Examples)

Git is a version control system at the heart of nearly every modern DevOps workflow. It enables teams to track code changes, collaborate efficiently, and automate software building, testing, and deployment. Hereâ€™s how Git fits into the DevOps ecosystem, along with real-world examples.

## Core Uses of Git in DevOps

### 1. **Version Control and Collaboration**

- **Track and manage changes:** Every modification to source code is recorded, with easy ways to view, compare, and revert changes if needed.
- **Team collaboration:** Multiple people can work on different features or bug fixes at the same time, using branches.
  
**Example:**  
A team uses GitHub to host their code. Each developer creates a new branch such as `feature/login` or `bugfix/payment-error`, works independently, and then merges their changes back into the main codebase with a pull request. This ensures everyone can see what is changing and why, facilitating peer code reviews and visibility.

### 2. **Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD)**

- Git repositories trigger automated pipelines when new code is pushed.
- CI/CD tools (like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) pull the latest code, run tests, build artifacts, and deploy code automatically.

**Example:**  
After a developer merges their code into the `main` branch, GitHub Actions starts a workflow that:
  - Checks out the new code.
  - Runs automated tests (unit, integration).
  - Builds a Docker image if tests succeed.
  - Deploys the application to a staging environment or production.

Teams always know deployments are based on the exact set of changes in Git at that point.

### 3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration Management**

- Infrastructure setup is stored as code (scripts, YAML, Terraform files) in Git for versioning and auditing.
- Teams can review infrastructure changes before they go live, the same way as application code.

**Example:**  
A DevOps engineer updates an `infrastructure.tf` file in the repository to add a new server. A pull request is created, team members review the changes, then merge it. An automated pipeline applies these changes to the cloud infrastructure, ensuring transparency and traceability.

### 4. **Audit, Rollback, and Disaster Recovery**

- Git keeps the history of all changes, so issues can be tracked and reversed quickly.
- Teams can restore a previous healthy state by checking out an earlier commit or reverting changes.

**Example:**  
If a deployment causes a serious bug, the team reverts to the last stable Git commit, restoring the application with one command and minimizing downtime.

## Summary Table: Typical Git Activities in DevOps

| DevOps Task               | Git Usage Example                            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Develop features/fix bugs | Work in feature branches, merge via PRs      |
| Code review/QA            | Pull requests trigger code review workflows  |
| Automated testing/deploy  | CI/CD tools run on new commits               |
| Infrastructure updates    | Store and review IaC code in Git             |
| Rollback/restore          | Checkout previous commits to revert releases |

## Why Git Matters in DevOps

- **Ensures traceability and accountability**
- **Enables team collaboration with minimal conflicts**
- **Drives automation in build, test, and deploy processes**
- **Reduces risk with powerful rollback and audit capabilities**

By integrating Git into every phase, DevOps teams deliver more reliable software, respond to incidents faster, and collaborate seamlessly.
