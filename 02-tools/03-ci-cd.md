# What is CI/CD in DevOps?  
CI/CD refers to **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**, two core practices in modern DevOps that allow teams to ship software quickly, reliably, and efficiently.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- Developers regularly merge code changes into a shared repository (such as GitHub).
- Each merge triggers automatic builds and tests.
- Goal: Catch bugs early, reduce integration issues, and ensure new code works well with the existing codebase.

## Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)

- **Continuous Delivery:** After passing all automated tests, code is always in a “deployable” state. Teams can release changes to production at any time, often with a manual approval step.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Goes a step further—every quality-checked change is automatically deployed to production without manual approval.
- Goal: Streamline the software release cycle, minimize manual intervention, and allow teams to release features and fixes rapidly and safely.

## How Does GitHub Actions Help with CI/CD?

**GitHub Actions** is a powerful automation tool built into GitHub that enables you to create custom software development workflows directly in your repository.

### Key Ways GitHub Actions Supports CI/CD

- **Automated Workflows:** Define “actions” that trigger on certain events (like pushing code, opening pull requests, or merging branches).
- **Pipeline Creation:** Easily configure steps for building, testing, and deploying applications—all from your code repository.
- **Scalable Automation:** Run jobs in parallel, across different environments, and automate nearly any aspect of your DevOps workflow.

### Example CI/CD Process with GitHub Actions

1. **Code is pushed to the repository.**
2. GitHub Actions triggers a workflow:
   - Checks out the new code.
   - Installs dependencies and runs tests automatically (CI).
   - Builds the application and, if tests pass, prepares deployment (CD).
3. If set up, GitHub Actions then deploys the application to a server, cloud platform, or hosting service—either automatically or with required manual approval.

#### Example Workflow Snippet

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./deploy.sh
        if: success()
```

### Benefits of Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD

- **Integrated:** Directly integrated with your code and pull requests.
- **Easy to Use:** Declarative YAML configuration.
- **Customizable:** Supports any language, environment, and deployment target.
- **Scalability:** Run jobs on GitHub’s infrastructure or your own servers.

| Practice   | What It Does                                                    | GitHub Actions Role                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| CI         | Automates building and testing new code changes                 | Runs builds/tests on every push/PR           |
| CD         | Automates deploying tested, production-ready code               | Automates or approves deployments            |

GitHub Actions turns your DevOps workflow into an automated, reliable assembly line—helping deliver high-quality software with less manual effort and increased confidence.
